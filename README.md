# FP Doc

This is a web app dedicated to analyse the datasets by being fast and efficient along with a precise report generation by the app. It first takes in the three types of data that is
Standard public avaliable information along with model specific information and data driven charts. We first provide all the 3 types of information along with a csv file which is uploaded on the app and then we generate precise graphs with the given attributes in the dataset.It's then converted into a neatly structured report which can later be downloaded as a PDF too for better mobility.
